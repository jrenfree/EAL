# EK80 Adaptive Logger (EAL)

The EK80 Adaptive Logger (EAL) interfaces with the Simrad EK80 software to modulate the ping interval and logging and display ranges based on the seabed depth. For example, as the seabed becomes shallower, the echosounder can accordingly record to a shallower range, which in turn allows for a shorter ping interval (or faster ping rate). Additionally, the EAL has the option to further modulate the ping interval to avoid aliased seabed echoes (aka false bottoms), which occur when the seabed reflection from a prior ping reaches the transducer during a subsequent ping recording.
